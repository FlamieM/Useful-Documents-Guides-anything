Well, I guess I can finally talk about the Dev Units huh? :p

SDEV:
Firstly, Here we have the SDEV, much like its predecessor the Wii U : "CAT-DEV", it has a built in Debugger and Capture as well as the option for expansive memory. [Up to 3 additional GB of ram for testing]!
Their is an upgradeable NAND storage option at the time of purchasing for $250.00 more.
SDEV itself is $1,500 by default, which includes the Debugger and Capture options with there respective licenses.
Here is a Picture of the SDEV I originally posted on October 19th , 2016 : The night before the Nintendo Switch Reveal : [​IMG]

EDEV:
Secondly, Here we have the EDEV, much like its predecessor the Wii U : "CAT-R", it resembles the retail console for final testing. [Since it resembles retail, it has no debugging features nor expandable memory]!
Their is an upgradeable NAND storage option at the time of purchasing for $250.00 more as well on EDEV!
EDEV itself is $800 by default and $1,000 with the upgradable Nand storage.
Here is a Picture of the EDEV:
