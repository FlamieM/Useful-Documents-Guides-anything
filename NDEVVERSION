You must have already seen this mentioned in the documentation?

In the first revision of "Revolution Operating System" 27/02/2006 it lists the return values as:

    OS_CONSOLE_RETAIL2 - HW2 production board
    OS_CONSOLE_RETAIL1 - HW1 production board
    OS_CONSOLE_DEVHW2 - The second game development system
    OS_CONSOLE_DEVHW1 - The first game development system
    OS_CONSOLE_MINNOW - A prototype system without graphical capabilities
    OS_CONSOLE_ARTHUR - PowerPC 750 evaluation board
    OS_CONSOLE_PC_EMULATOR - PC emulator
    OS_CONSOLE_EMULATOR - Mac emulator

It also says that the OS_CONSOLE_MINNOW and OS_CONSOLE_ARTHUR where console types used only for system bring-up within Nintendo and its partner companies.

In later SDK's the function returns different values. 

    Yes you are right, those are the same values returned from the Dolphin SDK.

    The earliest OS header files that I have are from Wii SDK 2.1 and like you say, those do have the extra definitions for the RVL consoles.

    The "Revolution Operating System" document that I quoted above was dated 27/02/2006, so maybe Nintendo added the extra strings before the initial release of the Wii SDK.

    Would be great if we had an early SDK.
