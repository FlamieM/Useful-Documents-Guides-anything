    Hi,

    I've recently picked up an NPDP-GDEV that came with an ODEM card, and also a stone-age PC that supports it, and decided to document some of the tools / dev environment through videos, since the only videos I've found thus far only show the devkit from the outside..

    I'll be making more videos soon showing off some more demos and tools that came with the SDK.

    Not sure if this is legal here but if anyone reading this has any NPDP cartridges or other GameCube dev hardware for sale, please let me know (or e-mail me: contact ((at)) hugo ((dot)) fyi)
